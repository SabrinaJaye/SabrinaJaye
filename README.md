### About me

**[She/Her, They/Them](https://en.pronouns.page/@sabrinajward)**

I'm Sabrina, professional Bioinformatician & Scientific Programmer and retro computing enthusiast.

I did my PhD in Evolutionarry Genomics at the University of East Anglia and since then have worked
as a PostDoc at the Earlham Institute. Biologically, my interests and background have been in
evolutionary and Population Genomics, and I focused on the role genetic exchange and gene flow play
in the adaptation of organisms to dynamic environments or situations such as "evolutionary arms-races".

Now I enjoy working on all kinds of systems and problems, from assembling complex polyploid genomes and
pangenomes, to downstream analyses inferring population history or functional analyses.
